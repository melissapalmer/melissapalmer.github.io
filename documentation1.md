I have become obsessed with documenting APIs and finding the easiest way to do this, without adding much more effort outside of coding the functionality of the API itself.

Within the blog posts under this category, I will add information about the challenges and adventures into documenting APIs for various coding languages. 

Why is documentation important?
> APIs are only as good as their documentation. A great API can be rendered useless if people don’t know how to use it, which is why documentation can be crucial for success in the API economy. 

However, creating documentation isn't something that most developers enjoy doing of have the luxury of time to do. Creating and Maintaining documentation takes time and effort. As such I set out to find the best way of Automatize API Documentation to make this a more manageable process. There are a number of tools and frameworks which can help: each comes with its own set of pro's and cons. 

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is one of these. Although widely used and well known, like [Andy Wilkinson](https://spring.io/team/awilkinson) explains in his [presentation](https://2015.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/documenting_restful_apis.html) at the Washington DC, at SpringOne2GX conference or how [Carlos Barragan](https://blog.novatec-gmbh.de/the-problems-with-swagger/) details in this blog post it comes with its own pro’s and cons. Which include: 

* Annotation Hell
** Swagger requires you to add many annotations to your code base. These Swagger annotations pollute the code and make it very difficult to read and maintain. 
* Structured in terms of URIs
