Why is API documentation important 
APIs are only as good as their documentation. A great API can be rendered useless if people donâ€™t know how to use it, which is why documentation can be crucial for success in the API economy. 

However, creating documentation isn't something that most developers enjoy doing of have the luxury of time to include. Creating and Maintaining documentation takes effort and patience.

My project to experiment with is at: https://github.com/melissapalmer/springboot-restdoc-swagger
