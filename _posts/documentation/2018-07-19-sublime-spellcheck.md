For some reason Sublime has its spell checker disabled by default. 

To enable this do to ... 

Preferences --> Settings --> and add the following to Preferences.sublime-settings -- User
```
	"spell_check": true
```

Save that file then spell check will be enabled you will see spelling errors underlined as below: 
![View Sublime Spelling Error](/assets/images/documentation/sublime-spelling-error.JPG)
and be able to right click on the incorrect word to select right one. 

**OR  OR  OR  OR  OR  OR**
 as I have just found out simply enable under: 
 
View --> Spell Check
