description: Creating API Documentation with Spring.

Inspired by [Keycloak Admin REST API](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/4.1/rest-api/index.html) I wanted to create documentation for my REST API that included: example request/respones, nice formatting of the models with as little extra effort above the coding as possible. 

Looking around within the Java/Spring world there seem to been two options SwaggerUI and/or Spring REST Docs.

My project to experiment with is at: https://github.com/melissapalmer/springboot-restdoc-swagger

The Spring Boot RestDocs page is here: [https://melissapalmer.github.io/springboot-restdoc-swagger/]
